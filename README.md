# OKR (Objective Key Results) Project Management System
A Comprehensive OKR Project Management System

## Introduction
About the Project:

This project showcases the design and implementation of an OKR-based project management system tailored for a fictional B2B organization, PeopleCore Consulting - an HR advisory firm specializing in talent optimization, leadership development, and workforce analytics.

As the company scales its client base and internal operations, leadership identified a growing disconnect between high-level strategic goals and day-to-day execution. To address this, an OKR (Objectives and Key Results) framework was adopted to:

- Align teams around clear, measurable goals

- Improve visibility into project progress and outcomes

- Foster a culture of accountability and focus

This case study walks through the OKR implementation process, tools used, challenges faced, and how success was measured, with realistic mock data and artifacts.
