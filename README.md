# OKR (Objective Key Results) Project Management System
## PeopleCore Consulting: OKR Project

## Introduction
About the Project:

This portfolio project showcases a structured OKR-based project management system designed for PeopleCore Consulting, a fictional B2B HR advisory firm that partners with mid-sized organizations to optimize talent acquisition, leadership development, and employee engagement.

As PeopleCore scaled its services, it recognized a need to improve recruitment efficiency across client organizations. This OKR system was developed to align the firm's internal delivery teams with client outcomesâ€”primarily increasing successful hire rates.

This case study documents the setup, execution, and tracking of OKRs focused on enhancing recruitment effectiveness, along with reflections and learnings from the process.
